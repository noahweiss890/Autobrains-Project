# Autobrains Data Engineer Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the tasks completed as part of the Data Engineer position application for Autobrains.

## Task Details

### Part 1: Calculate the average IOU metric
- Implemented Python script to calculate the average Intersection over Union (IOU) metric.
- Included a histogram plot to visualize the distribution of IOU values.
- Determined the minimum and maximum height of boxes passing a specified IOU threshold.

### Part 2: Choose frames for training
- Utilized results files and matching methodology from Part 1 to select frames for training.
- Created a list of images suitable for the tagging pipeline and model training.
- Provided code, rationale, and logic behind image selection.

### Part 3: Data Anomalies Report
- Conducted analysis to identify anomalies in the data.
- Documented and illustrated anomalies comprehensively.
- Included explanations on how anomalies were discovered and suggestions for addressing them.

### Part 4: Pipeline Designing and Presentation
- Designed a comprehensive pipeline for 'Train Data Tagging' based on the provided use-case and previous sections.
- Developed a presentation slide encapsulating the pipeline for easy understanding.
